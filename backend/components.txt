Backend Components by Christos Mouchlis

*bcryptjs and jsonwebtoken (JWT) these are for the part Auth & Security 

so these are for all of us:

Node.js (Backend runtime) runs the server and executes JavaScript code.
 
Express.js Web framework creates routes like register and login for the authentication system.

SQLite3 Database engine stores users locally in a file called hotel.db.
 
CORS Middleware allows access from frontend applications (react,html,)

Thunder Client(VS Code Extension) Testing tool used to test API routes directly without needing a frontend.

*To make the backend work you must install these components : 

Open the terminal inside the backend folder and run this command:

npm install express sqlite3 cors

node.js is app download it on your machines and then you have to open the terminal in your environment(in my case is VS code) and run this command: node -v  (to check that it works)

The server starts with commands: npm start or node server.js
